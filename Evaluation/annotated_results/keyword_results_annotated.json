Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!\"]\n    ",

The outer frame made of two interlocking dark pieces is only cm sqaure (and cm deep) and contained inside is a 2cm diameter silver coloured sphere which is also made in two halves and has a tennis ball type curly pattern on it. The sphere can move around freely 360 degrees and the frame pieces can twist around each other a little. Seems simple but when you stumble upon the solution after hours of fiddling and see the way it comes apart and the lovely unexpected nature of it, then you really can appreciate how clever it is. Until that point you get a very tactile puzzle which feels great in your hands with its smooth glossy finish but when you find the solution it\\'s like an elegant magic trick that has made most of my friends go \"ooh!\".

I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.

Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube.

Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!\"]\n    ",

It's a great way to encourage children to add, subtract, multiply and keep score of their own numbers.  This game can be fun too, roll two aaahhh!s consecutively and that's no point's. You can emphasise the aaahhh! in so many different tones that you can keep the kids laughing for ages, and it soon becomes known as the aaahhh! game.  Learning games where kids don't realise they are learning, I love them.  Love this game too, simple and yet so effective.  Fun for all ages.  Very pleased with this purchase\"]\n    ",

Great game for any Harry Potter fan - but you 'really' need to be a Harry Potter fan for some of the questions, however, we played it as part of the 'games' during a Harry Potter themed party. There were 2 teams (ages ) and only a few were fans but they all got very excited watching the clips and are now all going to read the books and perhaps watch the movies too (although the movies are a bit more frightening than the books). Actually they wanted to watch one of the movies afterwards. Think it's good to have teams rather than individual play so they can all bounce answers off each other. Good fun! It is quite an expensive game but I was lucky enough to purchase a used version for only \u00a39 and it was in fantastic condition. When my child was younger, we had the Disney version of 'scene it' which was fun too.

That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star\"]\n    ",

Compo hides from Boglin behind Land Rover.  Compo pulls/pushes the Land Rover.  This final one is done with Blu Tack on the back/front of Compo's chair.

The red and blue ones are very easy to find in the swimming pool where as the green and yellow are a little more difficult which creates endless fun for the kids to find. They can also be thrown quite far. As they land in the water they slowly sink so they also give you the chance to try and retrieve them before they reach the bottom.I would highly recommend these to others as they are a very good product and well made and create loads of fun.

Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!\"]\n    ",

I found this is perfect as there are no stickers so there's no icky bits peeling off giving the whole cube a much more stylish feel. It's great for showing off and doing finger tricks however the speed at which it spins does mean that I lose control of how many turns it does at once. Also, a few times it has happened that the center pieces have popped out because of the speed of the finger tricks, but it's not too big an issue as they popped back in just as easily as they came out. The only thing that made me consider not buying this specific cube was that I was told that not having stickers meant that the sides get scratched easily. I would like to address this issue. It is not true. My cube has been through everything: school bags, gravely floors, it fell out of my hands a few times and there are no scratches on it.

The title alone still makes me chuckle.  Visions of a group of old rascals, stretched out on a hill.  A small plate of brie and the sounds of country, (Mooing, Slight trickles of water, the intense silence of a farmer's wife). 'Might as well, lads!' One would say, in regards to the consumption of the WHOLE bottle which one of the old boys 'borrowed' from the Father Mason's (a fictional character's) vicarage!The reason I gave the product only four stars was because I have no idea why anyone would want the Land Rover.  As there is no driver, the vehicle must stay still.  I usually just use it as a prop.  For instance, Compo swerves around the Land Rover.  Compo peers into the Land Rover.  Compo hides from Boglin behind Land Rover.  Compo pulls/pushes the Land Rover.  This final one is done with Blu Tack on the back/front of Compo's chair.  Normally though, I find it easier to place Blu tack on Compo's feet as it looks betterer.All in all, an original toy that's good for playing around the sides of your bath on a Sunday night.

Each player (up to 4) gets a different shopping list consisting of 5 items, and by throwing the dice and moving around the board you can pick up the matching items if you land on the relevant squares.  The first to complete the shopping list is the winner.My kids quite like playing with this, they enjoy rolling the die and counting the squares to move.  They also like it when they can pick up the items on their list.What they don't like (and this happens a lot) is moving around the board again and again because they fail to get to the necessary square to pick up the one or two items remaining on their list.  Quite often all the players are stuck in a merry-go-round, going round and round the board because no one can hit the needed square to pick up the last item on the list.  There are two of each type of square (two grocery squares, two dairy squares, etc.) but this doesn't help as the item is only located at one of them, so if you're after milk and you land on the other dairy square then tough.If you're lucky you can finish the game quite quickly and everyone is happy, but if you're not able to land on the correct squares then the game develops into such tedium that your kids will get bored or angry.

Many years ago I was in the Merchant Navy and we used to play Bridge with my Kem cards, After a year of use, about 280 days playing Bridge in the evenings they got a bit dirty so I washed them and they came up like new. They are worth every penny.  Where are the good old KEMs?', 'On the warm up to my Christmas poker games I decided to improve my shuffling skills, so I dug up a few decks of nice cards and decided to go for it. The cards I was using were casino grade card, one pack cost around about 5GBP per pack and the other was around 8GBP. Both packs had been used for some games, but were still in pristine condition. In the space of a week I had wrecked the cheaper set with the more expensive set fairing better, but the edges were starting to separate. Both sets were permanently bent in the middle. Admittedly, I was making some mistakes and clashing edges against each other and roughly handling them as I bent them for a shuffle. I decided that I needed to invest in a more robust set of cards.I was reluctant to buy these due to the hefty 22 GBP price tag, thinking I could buy 4-5 sets for the same price, but I threw caution to the wind and I am glad I did. I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together, but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more \u203a  The best playing cards']\n    ",
