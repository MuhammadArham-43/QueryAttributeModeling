Where are the good old KEMs?', 'sleek', 'On the warm up to my Christmas poker games I decided to improve my shuffling skills, so I dug up a few decks of nice cards and decided to go for it. The cards I was using were casino grade card, one pack cost around about 5GBP per pack and the other was around 8GBP. Both packs had been used for some games, but were still in pristine condition. In the space of a week I had wrecked the cheaper set with the more expensive set fairing better, but the edges were starting to separate. Both sets were permanently bent in the middle. Admittedly, I was making some mistakes and clashing edges against each other and roughly handling them as I bent them for a shuffle. I decided that I needed to invest in a more robust set of cards.I was reluctant to buy these due to the hefty 22 GBP price tag, thinking I could buy 4-5 sets for the same price, but I threw caution to the wind and I am glad I did. I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together, but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more \u203a  The best playing cards']\n    ",

My son loves this and has added this to his vast collection of Sonic products. A nice letter also from the supplier. Thank you.  Fantastic!', \"This is a perfect edition to any collector who loves Sonic. After careful analysis I can confirm this is not a knockoff, the paint job is phenomenal, the figure has  one minor issue and that is on one of the faces there's a little blue smudge, that's probably just bad luck of my part and not the sellers fault.A great deal and the seller was very helpful, sending me e-mails when it was dispatched etc...  Bought as a Gift\", 'Perfect', 'An Official Sonic Nendoroid from the Good Smile Company and it is glorious.The paint job is fantastic, the plastic feels good to the touch and the accessories are the best compared to every other Sonic Figure ever.This is a display piece figure for posing and showing off. Not for playing with, as it is quite delicate. However this is what I bought it for so I am very happy.  Fantastic product and a great delivery service', \"I purchased the Sonic Nendoroid figure as a gift for my partner who adores all things Sonic related (I haven't given it to him yet and he doesn't know about it!)I have checked over the figure (without removing it from it's packaging) to ensure that it is a real Nendoroid figure - and by my investigation it is indeed!! I'm incredibly pleased and I can't wait to see my partner's face when I give this wonderful figure to him!I've read in other reviews for this product that the limbs fall out etc - this is not a toy, it's a posable figure for display so will most likely not suit those who are planning on 'playing' with it a lot. My partner and I are currently setting up a display cabinet to show off our varied collections of game memorabilia, so this figure is ideal for us.I hope this review helps.

Available from both the Disney Store and The Lego shop, so dont be fooled into paying collectors prices. Me and the 25 year old loved putting the model together, took about 20 minutes and is quite straightforward. The 4 year old has had great fun playing with the models, making up his own games and stories with them. He is also learning that lego comes apart and can be put together again - sometimes with different heads! So I think it is good for young children using role play and developing their fine motor skills. I have found the attachments for Buzz's helmet visor inadequate too - it comes off too easily. The spoiler on the back of RC is a little top heavy and needs regular refixing and the lights come off easily - but then hey it is lego & if bits come off your child is going to learn how to put them back again. A great toy, it has kept him busy literally for hours. Good value.  Grandma kept busy!\", 'My 4 yr old was desperate for some buzz and woody lego and loved letting Grandma construct the vehicle, a bit too fiddly for small hands.Hours of fun flying round the lounge, downside buzz helmet shield does not stay on but does not spoil the fun of the toy. Great fun for all.  He loves that little buzz lightyear figure - it goes everywhere', 'I bought this lego set for my godson for his 4th birthday. Probably a bit too complicated for him at the moment, but his dad and my six year old loved building it, and then the two children were playing for ages together. They really liked the Buzzlightyear and Woody characters. Would recommend this lego set, but for age 6 and above (as it says on the box!)  woody, buzz and RC']\n    ",

Good set of mixing options like elevator trim for flaps down, V-tail mixing, elevons for delta wings.You can 10 models programmed in (suitable to last you a few years if you're just starting out).There are rate switches for the elevator, aileron and rudder sticks (this way you can increase or reduce the sensitivity of these controls whilst in flight). The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.  But it does not lock down, so it is only useful for Nitro IC engines; electric motor propelled aircraft would need a permanently on/off switch.  (If are good at DIY electronics it's fairly easy to fit one yourself - I did this; although this would of course invalidate your warranty.)I have used this transmitter for two years before deciding to upgrade; by which time I knew what I wanted from a transmitter with the aircraft I've ended up flying the most.The price makes this one of the best starter units, but also that it is compatible with the Orange range of receivers (which use the DSM system as well), so you can get a receiver for each of your aircraft for about \u00a310 a time.\", 'Superb value, probably the best and most popular starter RC unit.

The AutoArt models which I own all have the following qualities in common. They are exacting in their attention to detail, both the exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the rubber tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching. The models are quite heavy and need to be handled with care.I bought my first AutoArt model car about six years ago and it still looks as good today as the day I opened the packaging. The one Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cleaning cloth if you're dusting them and get accidentally damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!), with the burgundy coloured and gold wheeled Michael Mann limited edition of the Ferrari 599.The prudent and best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, keeping it free from dust and finger grease. You can buy a suitable plastic or wooden display case for this model, either here from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take immense pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a fleet of Porsche 911's, several Bugatti Veyrons, a Koenigsegg CCX, a Pagani Huayra, and very many different types of Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Read more \u203a\"]\n    ",
