The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down, clean and refill of the shocks, and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps, so he need the shocks, shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so, Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road, pavement speed runs, dirt track racing...), our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40,  weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly, we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil, for uses as I have described above, then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it.

That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star\"]\n    ",

Good set of mixing options like elevator trim for flaps down, V-tail mixing, elevons for delta wings.You can 10 models programmed in (suitable to last you a few years if you're just starting out).There are rate switches for the elevator, aileron and rudder sticks (this way you can increase or reduce the sensitivity of these controls whilst in flight). The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.  But it does not lock down, so it is only useful for Nitro IC engines; electric motor propelled aircraft would need a permanently on/off switch.  (If are good at DIY electronics it's fairly easy to fit one yourself - I did this; although this would of course invalidate your warranty.)I have used this transmitter for two years before deciding to upgrade; by which time I knew what I wanted from a transmitter with the aircraft I've ended up flying the most.The price makes this one of the best starter units, but also that it is compatible with the Orange range of receivers (which use the DSM system as well), so you can get a receiver for each of your aircraft for about \u00a310 a time.\", 'Superb value, probably the best and most popular starter RC unit.

Like a lot of board games, you need more than two players to get the most out of it. The concept is simple and fairly easy to follow, although there are certain cards in the deck that complicate the proceedings and add an element of luck so that adults don't completely dominate!Based on words, language and storytelling, I feel like this is a good tool for bringing a little literacy into your game time without being overly taxing or difficult. At five years old, however, I felt like our son was at the younger end of being able to manage a game (which is fair, because it's recommended for 6+).Overall I see us growing into this and enjoying it very mooch at holidays, though I do question the inclusion of a battery operated buzzer. The real attraction of board games comes from being able to just pick them up and play, so it could be frustrating if the battery ever runs out.  Fun game.\", \"We played this game the day it arrived and we enjoyed it.  We had two adults and two children (aged ) playing and it seemed like we could all play as FAIRLY equal levels, obviously helping along the youngest and old fogies like me!We didn't really play according to the rules, partly because I'd read a lot of Amazon reviews criticising the instructions as not quite working.  I did read but then discarded and we played a slightly different story-telling game, hiding the buzzer and timing each game.We ended up playing for well over an hour and packed up before we were completely fed up.  IMHO, that's a pretty good average for any board game the family plays.I have to say we all enjoyed it.  It was very encouraging to see the youngest member of our group laughing and joining in (with a little bit of help) and I'd say it was fun and, as another reviewer has said, a good stocking-filler for Christmas.  I certainly feel we'll be getting it out again, although it may not be very soon.On the whole, an enjoyable and fun game and (probably) educational too.\"]\n    ",

None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy\", \"The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it\", \"It's very eye catching.

I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.

That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star\"]\n    ",

That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star\"]\n    ",

They are exceptionally good value for what you get.Some of the corners are relatively sharp (such as on the D6 and D4), so the dice come to a stop fairly quickly when rolled, meaning that you're not waiting for a couple of seconds for the dice to stop moving when you want to get on with your game, this also means that they are less likely to give biased results. However some dice, like the D10s have particularly rounded edges, so I'll have to see how they distribute results.On the whole they seem to be very good. I look forward to using them in future.EDIT: I've had these dice for less than two hours and the paint has already started to chip off the D4. Not impressed by that.

I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth\", \"The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it\", \"the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it.  It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun\", \"This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.

The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.

One of a set of six of the same \"armour\" theme.My four year old grandson loves it and will soon be hoping for the others in this set.A little smaller , at about six inches , than I expected, but this doesn\\'t seem to matter.A fine safe toy.  High quality Toy Story figure', \"Meticulously crafted from the finest injection moulded plastic, This model stands a full 10cm tall (4 inches in old money). The model itself has a removable axe included and is pretty much that s all there is, and of course the best child's imagination, to make this a great little play thing.I would question the value for money for the RRP.And the super-strength plastic wrap that encases the product is a bit of a faff to say the least,For ages 3 and up some of the smaller parts could cause a chocking hazard.  Decent toy, if a bit unnecessary\", 'Great quality toy and faithful reproduction of the animated character. Not a huge amount of movement on the limbs and pretty small at well under 6 inches but well made. To be honest the main reason I have dropped a star is the current SRP of \u00a39 which seems to be very steep and I would have put a price tag of close to \u00a39 on it myself, perhaps this is aimed at an adult collector market? However that said the 5 year old I gave it to loved it so well done Mattel in that regard!', 'This is a fun actionfigure, which is a tie in to the TV special \"Toy Story - That Time Forgot\", which is a 20 minute short about the Toy Story gang meeting some not-too-friend Dinosaurs.Both my children () love these figure, with my youngest re-enacting scenes from the TV and my eldest co-opting them into her ongoing teddy soap opera.  There are six to collect - Buzz, Trixie and Woody from original Toy Story and three protagonists.Smallish, at about 5 inches high, but beautifully detailed and it does have the feel of quality and isn\\'t just another piece of plastic tat.At \u00a310 each the full collection will prove expensive, and for that I\\'m rating four stars, although ignoring the price complete this is a five start product.  Really nice', 'This is a really nice little Buzz.It is a lot, lot smaller than what I had expected to receive, and in that respect I would say it is almost more of a model to put on a shelf than an actual toy. It is crafted well, and there is a lot of detail for such a little model.It is nicely painted, and it is very clear a lot of effort has gone into this.I would not recommend it for small children, as there are very small parts that may be hazardous, but it would be a great add on to anybody who loves buzz and collects these kind of items.  Meticulously crafted', \"First impression was that the figure looked a lot smaller than it did on my computer screen. But it feels solid and appears to be of a generally high build standard with very basic points of articulation. It doesn't do a whole lot but is nice looking and obviously very recognisable as a part of the series. As a cynical adult, I can't help but look at these as a blatant attempt to expand a franchise purely to create more merchandise to sell, but my sins are big Toy Story fans and they don't seem to have a problem with this...  Good quality steep price.\", \"I'd say Buzz is is about  inches tall here.Buzz is nicely printed with good accurate colours, but I'm not so find of the armour he is wearing - it is a boring dark grey with red splotches here and there. It is not removable.The other gripe is the accessory - a battle axe which will get lost within a week. I fail to see the point of the little objects that are potential choking hazards. It has basic movement.Overall, the kids love It. Not too expensive  A FINE TOY\", 'the kit doesnt suit him']\n    ",

That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star\"]\n    ",

It is only a minor quibble, but some of the numbers on the dice are not fully filled in, not so much that they can't be read, they are very legible. They are exceptionally good value for what you get.Some of the corners are relatively sharp (such as on the D6 and D4), so the dice come to a stop fairly quickly when rolled, meaning that you're not waiting for a couple of seconds for the dice to stop moving when you want to get on with your game, this also means that they are less likely to give biased results. However some dice, like the D10s have particularly rounded edges, so I'll have to see how they distribute results.On the whole they seem to be very good. I look forward to using them in future.EDIT: I've had these dice for less than two hours and the paint has already started to chip off the D4. Not impressed by that.

Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it\", \"This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy\", \"Damn tricky, but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth\", \"It's very eye catching.

The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it\", \"It's very eye catching. Once into it's cube people do ask how you can do it if it's all the same colour and then impressed how it changes form once turned!My son loves things that gives him attention and this does the trick! It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun.\", \"This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy\", \"Damn tricky, but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth\", \"the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it.  It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun\", \"It was a gift for my partner. He loved it a lot... The only thing was the gold plates were easily peeled and scratched... also there was a clicking noise when he turns it in a certain way... Other than that, it's a perfect way to lose track of the whole day!  dont read anymore reviews and just buy one!\", 'Poor Quality', 'One grandchild collects these,  another for the collection, he loved it , plays with several all day long if allowed  Great puzzle', 'Mmm well i am 40 and can do the rubicks cube inabout 10 min everytime ok not a speeder but still if.........look trust me stop reading and buy both the mirror and the gold version you not regret it, i had to wake the wife up when i got mine i wa so happy how it works when you have the nack to mix it up which is hard to start with you can really start to scratch your head, i have a autistic 2 year old with a 10 minute this is intresting span and then throw it and she loves playing with them (prefers the silver mirror one) and will then give it me to put it right, so yeah trust us both and buy both you will love them no cube set is done without these i would add a mixed up photo for you but that would spoil it im sure.  Great variant on the standard cube']\n    ",

I really like this one, although I would've loved being able to switch looks byhaving the option to remove the hood/rubber cloak. That way, you could achieve that slick look from later in the film.Perhaps that's for another wave of this Black Series.  Amazingly detailed figure\", \"I bought this guy, Phasma and a First Order Stormtrooper for my Star Wars mad nephew but even though he was chuffed to bits with them, I had issues with the look of them. The Stormtrooper was very badly painted, Phasma looks good but is just painted grey not chrome but Ren was awful. The silver paint round his mask looked like it had been done by a heavy drinker with the DTs. His silver belt buckle wasn't even finished as half the silver was missing and don't get me started on the mixture of cloth and rubber for his costume. These figures aint cheap and my nephew picked up on the errors right away as he has most of the Black Series figures and most of them are really well presented. Are these figures shoddily done to quickly get them out in the shops by the time the movie hits theatres? It's a shame The Force Awakens Black Series figures are this badas the OT ones are really good. Give these a miss unless you can get them real cheap.  Disappointing.\", 'The Force is not with them...', \"Very good figure. Great detailing especially on the material of Ren's costume and like the real cloth parts.You can get some really dynamic poses out of this figure with it's extensive articulation.  Try and find one in a shop, rather than ordering online.\", 'This figure is amazing... this is the first black series figure I have bought and it is just fantastic... the detail is amazing and can get into so many poses.

Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it\", \"This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy\", \"Damn tricky, but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth\", 'Mmm well i am 40 and can do the rubicks cube inabout 10 min everytime ok not a speeder but still if.........look trust me stop reading and buy both the mirror and the gold version you not regret it, i had to wake the wife up when i got mine i wa so happy how it works when you have the nack to mix it up which is hard to start with you can really start to scratch your head, i have a autistic 2 year old with a 10 minute this is intresting span and then throw it and she loves playing with them (prefers the silver mirror one) and will then give it me to put it right, so yeah trust us both and buy both you will love them no cube set is done without these i would add a mixed up photo for you but that would spoil it im sure.  Great variant on the standard cube', \"It's very eye catching. Once into it's cube people do ask how you can do it if it's all the same colour and then impressed how it changes form once turned!My son loves things that gives him attention and this does the trick! It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun.\", \"the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it.  It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun\", \"It was a gift for my partner. He loved it a lot... The only thing was the gold plates were easily peeled and scratched... also there was a clicking noise when he turns it in a certain way...
