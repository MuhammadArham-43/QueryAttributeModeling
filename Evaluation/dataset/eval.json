I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together, but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more \u203a  The best playing cards"

                    "If the original Uno card game wasn't enough for you then take a look at this. It's more fun with the new 'Downpour' card, which can make ALL players or teams have to pick up an extra  cards, not just the next player, and the best plus to this new version is that it's waterproof! OK, so most of us don't play Uno in the bath or swimming pool, but these new plastic playing cards are incredibly durable, won't bend (unless you force them) and just look so cool even your teenagers are going to want to play.I would recommend this very affordable, very durable and very very cool game to all ages, from 5 - 105!  fabulous"

I would have happily paid more for a better quality 10mm thick coloured spot set, but couldn't find anything between these and a very expensive set of Dal Negro ones. They are cheap and perfectly ok. The tin they came in is bit retro looking and I think is actually nicer than the one shown, but hey its a tin.  Double Colour Dominoes"

Everything is chunky and well-made. Where the vehicles have been painted, the colours are bright and appealing, but it's nice to see that some sections retain their natural wood effect. Once assembled, the scoop section of the bulldozer can be moved up and down.  Good solid toy set at a great price",

It looks larger than I thought it would be and I think the  year old boy we bought it for will love it!

The spots and bar are nicely painted with no smudging etc, All of them are clean on the back and the same size. Maybe some of the poor reviews were just bad luck?  I would have happily paid more for a better quality 10mm thick coloured spot set, but couldn't find anything between these and a very expensive set of Dal Negro ones. They are cheap and perfectly ok. The tin they came in is bit retro looking and I think is actually nicer than the one shown, but hey its a tin.  Double Colour Dominoes"

This is a card game which in a fun and often hilarious way, encourages the family to think about the behaviour of all the family members.The points scoring enhanced the competitive element but overall I thought the fun of this game was guessing how different family members would react in different contexts or what their favourite options were out of an a, b, c list.It was enjoyed as much by our youngest family member as our oldest.A brilliant stocking filler for Christmas.  I can see how it would also be a great game to have with us on family holidays.We are now looking to see how well it works with groups of friends too.  Surprising fun!"

I have been looking for it in UK shops for some time.I knew from other reviews that the instructions were not in English, but I have been able to remind myself of the rules using the French version, so that wasn't a problem.The cards themselves are not particularly good quality and considering how expensive the game was I wish I had waited until they were old enough to play UNO proper, and used other more readily available card games for the time being.The star rating is misleading, because it does not, in my opinion, represent good value for money.  Great family fun"

I had a border collie (of unknown brand!) helping me out, but poor Shep got a few holes in his belly and was bleeding polystyrene 'beans', plus was a bit bulky for getting on the bus, so he has now gone into retirement.Patch is the new pup, and is absolutely fantastic. My only concern is that being predominantly white he might get grubby, then I will have to test how well he washes up. But it is a very realistic Jack Russell size, shape and colour - he even has dark rings around his eyes - and I have been stopped and asked 'is that real?' even by adults - personally I think that, although realistic, it's still fairly obviously a toy! It has a very solidly stuffed body and a stiff wire frame, despite other reviews I find mine doesn't pose well and pings back into the standing shape but I am happy with that.If I'm nit picking one of the seams along a back paw wasn't finished properly, but it was such a tiny fault as to be unnoticeable.This is not really a toy to snuggle up in bed with, but if you are after a realistic looking toy dog you won't go far wrong with one of Melissa and Doug's.

The upside is that the hobby brought out the 'mechanic' in him and that has been amazing to watch.Regular maintenance after every few hours of run time includes break-down, clean and refill of the shocks, and he has tested many different weight shock oils and different strength springs over the years. He is tough on these cars and has built several jumps, so he need the shocks, shock coils and shock oil to really stand up to the punishment. For the last year or so, Losi shock oils have become his favorite as their oils just seems to stand up well for a longer period of time.Depending on weather conditions and the type of running he is planning to do (off-road, pavement speed runs, dirt track racing...), our son will use different weight shock oils in the car... but his most frequently used oils are 40,  weight. Since he cleans the shock regularly, we typically purchase the larger 4 ounce bottles instead of smaller ones.If you are looking for a good remote control car or truck shock oil, for uses as I have described above, then our son totally recommends that you give Losi Shock Oil a try based on his experience with it. Highly recommended, especially in these more economically priced larger bottles.Go for it",

I think the box could be designed differently maybe even change the plastic inside to black as once several doors had been opened it was quite easy to look in and see the awaiting gifts. The gifts were varied, from boots to dresses to a Christmas doughnut \"pet\" which again my daughter liked. All in all a great gift calendar.  Great alternative to the chocolate classic!"

                    "I've just put this advent calendar together.  Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!"

                    "I enjoy the card game Phase 10, but I do find its length a bit frustrating.  That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star"

                    "Out of all the Hanayama puzzles this is my favourite. It is not the hardest but it such a wonderful piece of design. I just love it. First if all, it is quite small but weighty in your hand. The outer frame made of two interlocking dark pieces is only cm sqaure (and cm deep) and contained inside is a 2cm diameter silver coloured sphere which is also made in two halves and has a tennis ball type curly pattern on it. The sphere can move around freely 360 degrees and the frame pieces can twist around each other a little. Seems simple but when you stumble upon the solution after hours of fiddling and see the way it comes apart and the lovely unexpected nature of it, then you really can appreciate how clever it is. Until that point you get a very tactile puzzle which feels great in your hands with its smooth glossy finish but when you find the solution it's like an elegant magic trick that has made most of my friends go \"ooh!\".  Good puzzle",

As is typical of Gibsons, the jigsaw contains a variety of different shaped pieces including my favourite '4-pronged' kind, which I like to hide from others and keep until the very end and guaranteed that 'last piece' honour!The picture of a 1970s street scene is by Tony Ryan and there is a little piece about him on the reverse of the sturdy presentation box, which measures around 25 cm square.Made up, the jigsaw measures around 49 cm x 3 cm and fits comfortably onto a 500-piece puzzle carrier.The finished product is more obviously a 'jigsaw' picture than some others I have completed over the festive season so not a great one for gluing and displaying, if this is your thing.

However getting it back together is equally hard!I would recommend this for young adults up (say around 12). It is quite tricky and needs some dexterity to solve, but it is very satisfying when you do.For those not family with these puzzles, they aren't huge, but are well made, nicely finished and feel like quality gifts. It feels heavy in the hand and doesn't have any sharp edges or unsightly moulding flaws.Overall an excellent small gift or stocking filler to entertain the determined puzzle solver.  Donuts Puzzle"

Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it",

Could only find, at one time, in USA, and the firms there were unable to ship to UK. Delighted at last, to find one through Amazon, though shipped from Germany. (Made in Italy, I believe). All it is, is a thick plastic base, curved slightly to enable rocking motion. The deflated legs of the toy are inserted into holes in the base, and the toy re-inflated. Makes a great rocker, and children love it. Not too expensive, and fast delivery. Recommended if you want a rocker for your existing Rody. My grandchildren love it. This item should to be more easily available to buy with the Rody.  great item"

                    "Excellent starter radio-control unit. Four main controls and two switches (generally used for under-carriage and flaps). Good set of mixing options like elevator trim for flaps down, V-tail mixing, elevons for delta wings.You can 10 models programmed in (suitable to last you a few years if you're just starting out).There are rate switches for the elevator, aileron and rudder sticks (this way you can increase or reduce the sensitivity of these controls whilst in flight). The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.  But it does not lock down, so it is only useful for Nitro IC engines; electric motor propelled aircraft would need a permanently on/off switch.  (If are good at DIY electronics it's fairly easy to fit one yourself - I did this; although this would of course invalidate your warranty.)I have used this transmitter for two years before deciding to upgrade; by which time I knew what I wanted from a transmitter with the aircraft I've ended up flying the most.The price makes this one of the best starter units, but also that it is compatible with the Orange range of receivers (which use the DSM system as well), so you can get a receiver for each of your aircraft for about \u00a310 a time.",

So I think it's probably better for 2 1/2 and up, unless you are very good at supervising puzzles, or have a more patient child than I do.  Entertaining & fun",

                    "This is a great board game for families with two or more children, I'd say. Like a lot of board games, you need more than two players to get the most out of it. The concept is simple and fairly easy to follow, although there are certain cards in the deck that complicate the proceedings and add an element of luck so that adults don't completely dominate!Based on words, language and storytelling, I feel like this is a good tool for bringing a little literacy into your game time without being overly taxing or difficult. At five years old, however, I felt like our son was at the younger end of being able to manage a game (which is fair, because it's recommended for 6+).Overall I see us growing into this and enjoying it very mooch at holidays, though I do question the inclusion of a battery operated buzzer. The real attraction of board games comes from being able to just pick them up and play, so it could be frustrating if the battery ever runs out.  Fun game.",
                    "We played this game the day it arrived and we enjoyed it.  We had two adults and two children (aged ) playing and it seemed like we could all play as FAIRLY equal levels, obviously helping along the youngest and old fogies like me!We didn't really play according to the rules, partly because I'd read a lot of Amazon reviews criticising the instructions as not quite working.  I did read but then discarded and we played a slightly different story-telling game, hiding the buzzer and timing each game.We ended up playing for well over an hour and packed up before we were completely fed up.  IMHO, that's a pretty good average for any board game the family plays.I have to say we all enjoyed it.  It was very encouraging to see the youngest member of our group laughing and joining in (with a little bit of help) and I'd say it was fun and, as another reviewer has said, a good stocking-filler for Christmas.  I certainly feel we'll be getting it out again, although it may not be very soon.On the whole, an enjoyable and fun game and (probably) educational too."

                    "This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy",

Using the advent calendar box as the backdrop, you can place the LEGO pieces on the cardboard part of the box, and can be enjoyed by friends and family opening the advent flaps counting to each day.

It's very big (perhaps about one-and-a-half times as big as a typical top shop chess set) but it is beautifully made.  It looks, feels and smells fantastic.This is a Christmas present for my 10-year old grandson, who has just discovered the game and joined his school's chess club.  Currently he is playing with a little magnetic travel game.  I think his eyes will pop out of his head when opens this set.

Though I have never used a folding chess board, I find this would be more suitable, especially has it actually holds the chess pieces inside.The board seems robust enough and the pieces are wood, weighted and with felt.  The king is a normal three inches odd height, so all in all should be most satisfactory. If he plays at a club or with friends at least he has the proper set.Tom Crossley  Small defects that are annoying"

The pieces are a a little plastic-y, at first they look metal and they are dense, but they are plastic none the less. Some pieces with thin arms were a little bent, but no problem to gentle push back into shape. The bending was probably due to the internal tight packaging and perhaps postage.Overall its a good set with a fun theme, good for children about 7+ I would say. Excellent as a joke present for someone getting into / re-starting chess and loves the Simpsons  Excellent"

BEAUTIFULLY designed mice, cat and unit - nothing cheap and no expense spared! The game is enjoyable at any age as light entertainment, and it's the usual fun and thrill of the mice being caught by the cat - but there's quite a few different rules and `quirky' things that go on thrown in for good measure!I can't imagine any young child not loving this game!"

The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star"

                    "I've just put this advent calendar together.  Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!"

You can get fantastic papo figures to go with the product which are also excellent quality and a castle playmat is also available from papo to go with it.

It's a great way to encourage children to add, subtract, multiply and keep score of their own numbers.  This game can be fun too, roll two aaahhh!s consecutively and that's no point's. You can emphasise the aaahhh! in so many different tones that you can keep the kids laughing for ages, and it soon becomes known as the aaahhh! game.  Learning games where kids don't realise they are learning, I love them.  Love this game too, simple and yet so effective.  Fun for all ages.  Very pleased with this purchase"

It comes in quite a small box, but cathedral is quite big once assembled. My daughter just turned 9, so I had to help her with putting together some parts (especially roof of dome). I wanted to spend some quality time with my daughter, so it was a perfect present for both of us. I think I loved assembling it as much as she did. I am definitely going to buy more similar products. It is educational and fun, but would not recommend for kids under 9, as they would get bored with it, as parent would have to do most work.  fun"

Great game for any Harry Potter fan - but you 'really' need to be a Harry Potter fan for some of the questions, however, we played it as part of the 'games' during a Harry Potter themed party. There were 2 teams (ages ) and only a few were fans but they all got very excited watching the clips and are now all going to read the books and perhaps watch the movies too (although the movies are a bit more frightening than the books). Actually they wanted to watch one of the movies afterwards. Think it's good to have teams rather than individual play so they can all bounce answers off each other. Good fun! It is quite an expensive game but I was lucky enough to purchase a used version for only \u00a39 and it was in fantastic condition. When my child was younger, we had the Disney version of 'scene it' which was fun too. I think kids enjoy the fact that their knowledge on the subjects are so good, they can beat their parents :-)"

If I had to nitpick about them, I would say that they are a bit pointy on the corners, but that leads to only a mild annoyance. The deck box is clearly high quality upon handling it, however as I've used it a lot, putting decks in and taking decks out, I've become fairly concerned about the hinge on the back being damaged. The box, however, does hold plenty of cards, 100 sleeved I've managed to get in, perfect for holding an EDH/Commander sleeved decks. I'm sure it could fit many more unsleeved. As for the size of the sleeves and the box, all cards fit in them but they are designed for standard sized cards, like MTG or Pok\u00e9mon cards, rather than Yu-Gi-Oh! cards.  Awesome customer service",

The sleeves have an excellent feel to them, and I highly recommend the matte over the plastic covers as the matte just feels so much better, and makes it slightly easier for shuffling. Overall a great product.",

                    "These are great quality card protectors.  They look good and are easy to shuffle and play with.  It little bit pricey, but ultimately worthwhile.  The deck box is a bit on the cheap side, but it does the job.  I mostly get this deal as it's cheaper than buying two packs of these sleeves separately and you get a cheap deck box thrown in for good measure.  Very Satisfied",

It also allows for easy shuffling without damaging the edges of the cards at all because the sleeves slide between one another.If you are looking for a box to hold a deck (could easily fit 90 sleeved cards inside) then this is a good choice.

A very simple game but lots of fun and older ones can join in too without being bored. This game takes about 10 minutes max to play so is ideal for the attention span of a pre-school child.

It stresses the memory (my memory at least) and acts as a fast and fun version of reading flash cards!

I played this game with my son (7) and daughter (10) quite a few times and they got the jist of the game after about the 4th play.  The game is ok, setup is a pain - loads of dice to sort and place. The game plays quite quick once you get going, although there are some major flaws in the game which can ruin it (wizzkids have released new rules with latest expansion to sort the problems) Basically if you get any dragon card and cull your low powered dice as quick as possible, your gonna win..  not maybe you'll win.. you will win.  Its a fun game,although we have not played it now for around 6monhts.  If you want to learn the rules..  (as the written rules dont really explain much) check out this video.[...]  Amazing game, but buy it from the UK for goodness sake"

                    "I received one of these as a christmas present from a friend. Since then I have bought myself another three. Each box holds about 2000 cards, maybe more. The box comes with 6 card divides, and a sheet of labels. I divide my cards up according to colour, and type. So even with 4 boxes I have had to make extra divides. Each box also comes with a list of labels, but you only get one label for enchantments, sorceries, artifacts ect ect, per sheet/per box, but there are blank labels you can add your own text on.Considering the price of booster packs these days, and the fact that this container comes with 4, this product is extremely good value for money (Or that was true when I bought the product January 2015) as the price of the container is less than the price of 5 booster packs.If you're looking for good storage, that is also value for money. This is it.  Great if cheap"

                    "This Corgi model is intended as model for adult collectors rather than as a toy.This model Austin Princess is finished in Maroon Red and specifically depicts a version of the car used by the Metropolitan Police Diplomatic Protection Group in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The model captures the shape of the Austin Princess very well, and, it is the detailed parts on it such as the blue light, roof lights, windscreen wipers and wing mirrors that make it a good model but unsuitable toy. Those parts are both delicate and could represent a hazard if snapped off. The model also captures the \"slope\" from rear to front of this distinctive car together with accurately reproduced wheels which were often fitted with \"Denovo\" run flat tyres.A real piece of motoring and London Police nostalgia accurately reproduced by Corgi Vanguards."

The mast with the flag on doesn't stand up straight but tends to be at about 45 degrees. My 4 year old boy and his mates love this toy and wack each other repeatedly with the swords until one cries and we we take them away! The water cannon is surprisingly powerful and accurate but we are on a water meter - D'oh!  pirates of the pool"

                    "I cant even begin to tell you how much I love this toy! Similar products are soooo expensive compared to this one. I bought it for my son's 4th birthday last week. The crane claw goes up and down, back and forth and the arm rotates. There is also an alternative little platform that can be used instead of the claw. It looks striking and is taller than my son which makes it a really bold, lovely toy! If you have a child who is into knocking things over, it wont be suitable as it will fall over with a good push. This doesn't mean it falls over easily as we all know little kids are strong and like things to crash! My sons autistic and hyper all the time and he manages not to push it over so most 3-4 year olds plus will be fine. Theres space for a little figure to sit in the drivers seat (I didn't get a figure with it as the picture suggests) and theres also a little counter balance box the other end of the arm and a platform. Its just a lovely lovely toy and my son adores it. If you have like JCB digger toys or a duplo farm set or similar you can do some lovely play. Im rather delighted with it and Ive already convinced a mum friend to get it for her son's 4th in a few months! :)  Looks good when built up but a Total Disaster"

The only annoying thing is that I can't beat my husband at it... he thinks it is more of a men's game... grrr! I will have to change that.It is a card game, and you have to play the most valuable cards at the right time. Some of the utility cards if you can get them will help immensely.The aim of the game is to get 60 gold first, by using cards, and buying and selling African goods. It takes about 30 minutes per game, and it is a nice small little box so great to take with you on a holiday. It is rated as a 12years plus game, but I would immagine anyone from  would pick this game up ok. It is just for 2 players.  Jambo",

                    "These toy story lego kits are great! Available from both the Disney Store and The Lego shop, so dont be fooled into paying collectors prices. Me and the 25 year old loved putting the model together, took about 20 minutes and is quite straightforward. The 4 year old has had great fun playing with the models, making up his own games and stories with them. He is also learning that lego comes apart and can be put together again - sometimes with different heads! So I think it is good for young children using role play and developing their fine motor skills. I have found the attachments for Buzz's helmet visor inadequate too - it comes off too easily. The spoiler on the back of RC is a little top heavy and needs regular refixing and the lights come off easily - but then hey it is lego & if bits come off your child is going to learn how to put them back again. A great toy, it has kept him busy literally for hours. Good value.  Grandma kept busy!",

We already have Tom Kitten, Jemima, Miss Tiggy, Benjamin Bunny and Peter Rabbit. Now just need to get Flopsy and the Fox.  This was a fair price and arrived  promptly in clean condition.  It is a beanie toy so not really suitable for very young children as unsure how well it would wash, my daughter is almost 5 so it is perfect and will help the stories come alive.

It doesn't do a whole lot but is nice looking and obviously very recognisable as a part of the series. As a cynical adult, I can't help but look at these as a blatant attempt to expand a franchise purely to create more merchandise to sell, but my sins are big Toy Story fans and they don't seem to have a problem with this...

The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star"

                    "I enjoy the card game Phase 10, but I do find its length a bit frustrating.  That's why I enjoy playing Phase 10 Dice so much.  The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star"

The box is good and the value for money is great! However, I would have preferred for it to be a bit more centralised around certain colours or themes, as I now have ~100 cards I'll never use in my blue deck, with no one to trade with easily. The addition of the four Boosters is very nice though as it's almost cheaper to buy this box than it is to buy 4 boosters by themselves :D  Great for Beginners",

You get plenty of each type of land which is essential for building a deck. In the pack you also get a good selection of monsters that workwell with each other, there is a lack of powerful monsters but you might get lucky with the 4 booster packs which are usually \u00a34 each anyway. The value is  astounding, i am so happy with what i got for this amount of money and this has set me up nicely to build a great deck, i even got a legendary card in one of the booster packs that were included. I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants to start the game, you cannot go wrong with this!  Perfect starting point for all new MTG players!"

They last nearly 3 month of every evening playing and still its not in too bad shape except that they fade from lot of rubbing in shuffling and serious players dont like it. I still use dads used cards to play friendly card games with friends and they are still superior by a mile to the regular stuff u buy off the shelf. There is just no comparison.

                    "...in Series 2 'Evolutions' - so named because the original 80 Go Gos have kept their basic shape but changed colour and design in every conceivable way in the second wave or their quest for world domination.  Like the first series for my five-year-old son these are the next big thing. A packet of three Go Gos with stickers costs only one pound so they fall very nicely into the pocket money bracket. The figures themselves are small, colourful, durable and bursting with individuality and personality. Eighty to collect (plus different colour combinations) will keep him going.Get the new album as well (if you haven't already) - it is a must-have. Again, it costs only one pound and has comic strips this time and fun statistics about how much the new Go Gos have evolved.  It also has 80 new names for them all!  Why the five stars for educational value? Well, my son looks at this album all the time and can now easily recognise the numbers from 1-80. He also happily copies out the characters' names so improving his writing skills.Go Gos are still great - the only downside is they get everywhere in our house. From personal experience it's not nice to tread on one with bare feet!!  great pocket money toy"

When I finally sat down to learn it, I was hooked.  It reminds me of years ago, playing Operation as a kid, trying it use a steady hand.  One of the other reviewers mentioned knocking the table... keep the dog away too!!!!!!!A BIG thumbs up for this cracking little game!  fantastic",
                    "This is a great game.  I played this game with my cousin 10 years my junior.  We had so much fun.  Its suitable for adults and children alike.Even my father who never joins in a game found it very interesting.  You have to have a steady hand but sometimes it just comes down to luck!I would recommend this for any family or groups of friends who are looking for a new fun game.  polarity"

I'll give the makers and other users this invention for nothing!Have recommended to several friends. Fair price, super family game."

The game has no limit on the number of people wishing to play it - even one person can play alone. The game only requires logic to play it - it has no complicated rules. I would suggest that the game is suitable for anoyone older than 11 years.It is a superb game with many permitations and combinations of the board - so it is impossible to have the same experience with the game twice. It is a truely brilliant game with an educational spin that will develop speed of thought and logical thinking. *****  Fantastic game"

                    "If the original Uno card game wasn't enough for you then take a look at this. It's more fun with the new 'Downpour' card, which can make ALL players or teams have to pick up an extra  cards, not just the next player, and the best plus to this new version is that it's waterproof! OK, so most of us don't play Uno in the bath or swimming pool, but these new plastic playing cards are incredibly durable, won't bend (unless you force them) and just look so cool even your teenagers are going to want to play.I would recommend this very affordable, very durable and very very cool game to all ages, from 5 - 105!  fabulous"

I read all the reviews and all of them were very positive, plus, it looked the most solid and alot more affordable than most I had seen. I also liked the fact that it had lots of \"active\" things on it too. Another plus, is the fact that you can add figures, canons etc. so other members of my family have bought those to supplement the Castle and the Archer figure, so my 5 year old grandson is all set to go!

A small plate of brie and the sounds of country, (Mooing, Slight trickles of water, the intense silence of a farmer's wife). 'Might as well, lads!' One would say, in regards to the consumption of the WHOLE bottle which one of the old boys 'borrowed' from the Father Mason's (a fictional character's) vicarage!The reason I gave the product only four stars was because I have no idea why anyone would want the Land Rover.  As there is no driver, the vehicle must stay still.  I usually just use it as a prop.  For instance, Compo swerves around the Land Rover.  Compo peers into the Land Rover.  Compo hides from Boglin behind Land Rover.  Compo pulls/pushes the Land Rover.  This final one is done with Blu Tack on the back/front of Compo's chair.  Normally though, I find it easier to place Blu tack on Compo's feet as it looks betterer.All in all, an original toy that's good for playing around the sides of your bath on a Sunday night.  What's with the Land Rover though?  Five Stars",

It's amazingly detailed and I would have thought a 'must-have' for anyone who collects models of Land Rovers. The original HUE 166 has been written about and photographed in all the LR histories, and so it's nice to own a 3D version in this scale.

Whoever completes the 10 challenges with the lowest score is the winner. It is a game of luck but also strategy is involved. We have had hours of good fun."

Each round requires a player to pick up a new card and then discard a card, all the while trying to keep your identity hidden, go for big numbers, and find out (and eliminate) the other players. Turns plays out differently from game to game, but each time, just as you're starting to get an idea of who has what and how to beat them, the round ends! It's great! Don't get me wrong, you're paying for the idea here, as the contents of the game are very minimal, but it's hard to find a better card game for the money.  Highly recommended"

                    "Model Kasten have a reputation for quality hard plastic tracks. If they were cast in white metal they'd give Fruilmodel a run for their money. Then again there IS the difference between \u00a38-\u00a39 for MK & \u00a330 odd for Fruil... It is (for me) horses for courses. If I have a project that has a need for 'saggy' tracks, then I would put out (sotospeak} for Fruilmodel. For a Tiger, Panther, T-55, Bren Carrier, Type 97 etc. 'saggy' that you can see, are a must. Yes, you can glue plastic tracks so as to LOOK saggy... but the weight of metal tracks... Well, this really IS a \"me\" thing. 'Taught' (I hope I've spelt that right...) tracks & them as you can't see much of --- Sherman, Churchill, CharB, Somua, Maus, E100, Chieftain, Challenger, Abrams etc., yes, there are some very nice 'rubber band' tracks with kits these days.. again, it's pretty much a \"me\" thing. Actually some kits DO include some Very nice seperate-link tracks. Tamiya's CharB & Somua for two... 'Link and Lenght' turn up as an option as well. But for choice... and you would not believe how many different types of track the Sherman used in action (and they are all available from AfterMarket suppliers....) , I shop around for seperate links.As to THIS particular set of tracks. I don't need them right now but will put them together in front of the television, a few tracks at a time. When they are done, they will be boxed, ready for a deserving Sherman product (I have a nice photo of one from 16th/18th Hussars in mind). DON'T do them in a big hurry... you will frustrate the Living Daylights out of yourself or drive yourself Daft... Trust Me On This, lots of very tricky parts. But VERY nice when done. Like I say. Do a few at a time between other projects.Best of luckBill."

The rubber seals around the joints work a treat. The selection of water vehicles is interesting and fun and I love that you can turn the handle on one of the pop-in bits and create a current to send the boats round the canals. It is possible to play with this toy alone, all you do is sit near the pump and move the pop-in current maker to one of the closer sections of canal. We have lego divers swimming around and the odd matchbox car dropping in for a swim just to add to the fun. Now looking for the add on toys for this series :O)  Amazing Waterplay"

The pieces are large and easy for little fingers to pick up and all different shapes. Its colourful and there is so much detail in each individual room of the dolls house, which can lead to questions like \"how many clocks are there in the house\" or \"which animal is lying on the bed\". So it is excellent from an educational point of view encouraging observation, counting, colours etc. My only criticism is that it is not quite as durable as I would like, some of the paper is beginning to come away from the cardboard backing. However, this may be because it gets a lot of use.  Dolls House jigsaw",

My 3 year old will pick out this jigsaw before any other - a great educational toy.  Orchard Toys - excellent range of products"

When I first felt the overall weight on delivery I thought that perhaps the pieces weren't included - it really was that light. I guess my point is don't expect a chess set of any substance.But that aside, this set does provide decent value for money, the pieces are of good enough size, as is the board. I'd certainly recommend this as a starter chess set and also as an ideal full sized travel set due to it's light weight construction and it being able to fold in half for storage.

Reasonably priced wooden sets are pretty hard to find. I'm very happy with this one for the price. The pieces are a bit lighter than I would like, too easily knocked over, but they are well shaped and easily distinguishable which is the main important thing for learning. The board itself (other than a completely pointless labelling of rows and columns with letters and numbers) is great. Both board and pieces are a good size for both adults and children, and moving a piece has a good \"feel\" from the felt base of the pieces on the board. I think the feel of movement is very important to learning and enjoying chess, so if you after a budget set, this one fits the bill very well.  Perfect for adults, children, and beginners"

It is only a minor quibble, but some of the numbers on the dice are not fully filled in, not so much that they can't be read, they are very legible. They are exceptionally good value for what you get.Some of the corners are relatively sharp (such as on the D6 and D4), so the dice come to a stop fairly quickly when rolled, meaning that you're not waiting for a couple of seconds for the dice to stop moving when you want to get on with your game, this also means that they are less likely to give biased results. However some dice, like the D10s have particularly rounded edges, so I'll have to see how they distribute results.On the whole they seem to be very good. I look forward to using them in future.EDIT: I've had these dice for less than two hours and the paint has already started to chip off the D4. Not impressed by that.  Good product",

Unfortunately the bottm ring suddenly inexplicably deflated and has a leak. We were using it as a ballpit for our baby and at this height he can not throw himself out. We decided to order a new one. To our annoyance we have found that , despite carrying the same product code the new pool is significantly different and inferior to the last. It hs a total height of 18 inches which is the same as the original with a deflated bottom ring! As we had simply gone to our old order to reorder it we hadn't checked any product specs - not expecting them to so markedly change!The rings are around 4 inches in diameter and the whole pool feels smaller although the diameter is only slightly less.Very annpoyed that we have wasted money on this as baby cannot use it as it is less robust and not high enough for him to stay safely inside.  inflateable pool"

The kids love them (and adults too). They are quite small around 5-6\" diameter however they are brightly coloured. The red and blue ones are very easy to find in the swimming pool where as the green and yellow are a little more difficult which creates endless fun for the kids to find. They can also be thrown quite far. As they land in the water they slowly sink so they also give you the chance to try and retrieve them before they reach the bottom.I would highly recommend these to others as they are a very good product and well made and create loads of fun. They are also great value for money.  Olympics rings"

                    "I've just put this advent calendar together.  Having read the reviews on Amazon I was prepared for the fact that a bit of time would be required to put the calendar together, but felt compelled to add to what has already been said.  Last year I got the Playmobil animals of the forest advent calendar, where no preparation was required as all of the toys were already in the windows which simply needed popping open each day.For this design whilst there is a fair bit of preparation, however I'm sure that the boxes are easier for children to open than we experienced with the window design.  If your child doesn't damage the boxes and is willing to let you put the contents away (assuming you can find them all after Christmas) this advent calendar can be re-used next December if you so wish.There are 24 flat packed boxes each of which have to be filled with the particular items to gradually build your princess scene.  The boxes were packed in batches relating to where they appear on the calendar, but the instructions for what goes into each of the boxes is in numerical order, so I would advise that you sort the boxes into numerical order before you start.The items which are required to go into the boxes are also packed in little batches, but from my experience this did not particularly ease the process of sussing out what went where, most especially as there are quite a number of tiny flowers which go into various boxes, so I would agree that the best approach is to open everything up and work from there.Each box hangs from the advent calendar by use of a flap on the calendar and a flap on the box - make sure that you pop each flap on the boxes out before you close each lid!Read more \u203a  much better than chocolate!"

I think the box could be designed differently maybe even change the plastic inside to black as once several doors had been opened it was quite easy to look in and see the awaiting gifts. The gifts were varied, from boots to dresses to a Christmas doughnut \"pet\" which again my daughter liked. All in all a great gift calendar.  Great alternative to the chocolate classic!"

                    "This is not a toy, but a useful extension for Rody inflatable horse.  It turns it into a rocker, rather than a \"hopper\" toy. Searched high and low for this item for some time. Could only find, at one time, in USA, and the firms there were unable to ship to UK. Delighted at last, to find one through Amazon, though shipped from Germany. (Made in Italy, I believe). All it is, is a thick plastic base, curved slightly to enable rocking motion. The deflated legs of the toy are inserted into holes in the base, and the toy re-inflated. Makes a great rocker, and children love it. Not too expensive, and fast delivery. Recommended if you want a rocker for your existing Rody. My grandchildren love it. This item should to be more easily available to buy with the Rody.  great item"

                    "One grandchild collects these,  another for the collection, he loved it , plays with several all day long if allowed  Great puzzle",
                    "It's very eye catching. Once into it's cube people do ask how you can do it if it's all the same colour and then impressed how it changes form once turned!My son loves things that gives him attention and this does the trick! It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun.",
                    "Poor Quality",
                    "Damn tricky, but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth",
                    "The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it",
                    "the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it.  It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun",
                    "This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy"

Good set of mixing options like elevator trim for flaps down, V-tail mixing, elevons for delta wings.You can 10 models programmed in (suitable to last you a few years if you're just starting out).There are rate switches for the elevator, aileron and rudder sticks (this way you can increase or reduce the sensitivity of these controls whilst in flight). The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.

                    "Excellent starter radio-control unit. Four main controls and two switches (generally used for under-carriage and flaps). Good set of mixing options like elevator trim for flaps down, V-tail mixing, elevons for delta wings.You can 10 models programmed in (suitable to last you a few years if you're just starting out).There are rate switches for the elevator, aileron and rudder sticks (this way you can increase or reduce the sensitivity of these controls whilst in flight). The flap switch is up or down; you can not program a mid position - this is probably the main downside of this transmitter.There is a push button switch to cut the throttle.  But it does not lock down, so it is only useful for Nitro IC engines; electric motor propelled aircraft would need a permanently on/off switch.  (If are good at DIY electronics it's fairly easy to fit one yourself - I did this; although this would of course invalidate your warranty.)I have used this transmitter for two years before deciding to upgrade; by which time I knew what I wanted from a transmitter with the aircraft I've ended up flying the most.The price makes this one of the best starter units, but also that it is compatible with the Orange range of receivers (which use the DSM system as well), so you can get a receiver for each of your aircraft for about \u00a310 a time.",

                    "I bought these for my son last Christmas (he was 4 months old).  As soon as he was crawling he was able to play with them - rolling them and following them across the floor.  They kept him amused for ages considering a baby's usual attention span.  He also loved peek a boo games with them (hiding smaller pots inside bigger ones): cue squeals of delight as the smallest pot reappears!  He is now 15 months old and they are still a favourite: he can stack them or spends up to 20 minutes just working out which ones fit inside each other \"nesting\" them.  They are great for learning about colour and size, as well as developing motor skills.  The cups work well as bath toys as they have holes in the bottom.  Forget about flashing noisy toys, these cheap but durable cups will provide hours of fun.  I will be buying them for friend's babies from now on.  I can not recommend them enough!  What can you say?",
                    "My 5 month old Grand Daughter loves watching me build them for her to knock down but as she gets older I will enjoy teaching her to build them herself, teaching her colours and counting the cups. Very versatile toy can be used any where (bath,sand pit etc) easily cleaned and stack inside each other so don't take up room in her toy box. Definitely would recommend this toy, great value for money.  My son loves them and so do I"

You will need quite a bit of space (the rockets can travel!) and my step sons were supervised - which I would def. recommend for young children.  I would also recommend purchasing spare rockets at the same time, otherwise you may find yourself spending most of your time running around.  Super fun although not too tough"

It is covered in horrible matted bobbly bits and just looks grey and depressing. It just doesn't seem to clean up at all, hoovering makes no difference. Other reviewers have said you just need to look after it better, but this is a child's car playmat and should be able to withstand children playing on it with cars! May be fine at a grandparents house with occasional use, but if you want anything that lasts longer than a couple of months (which at this price, you do) then don't bother with this one. My daughter's pre-school have the same mat and it looks equally awful, while their cheap B&Q one looks great!DON'T BUY IT!  Please please don't buy this"

The modelling and paint work is truly brilliant and looks just how Sanji looks like he should be.BUT..The articulation with the figure is terrible.. If you're only looking to just stand him normally then you should get this figure. His legs can barely move so that makes posing for kicks impossible. This figure is extremely fragile so take the upmost care when dealing with this.Final score 7/10  Five Stars"

It doesn\u2019t feel cheap either.  The material is very forgiving!  Overall I love this product and will confidently wear it!  One star",

Dress has buttons down the back for easy fastening, fits well (Im between a 10 &12).  Shirt is short so do not expect a full lenght one but it does the job and covers where it should, not sure if legging are hold up or not as no rubber grip on the top but I think they just may stay up....time will tell.  All in all a good product, swift service and no complaints.  Will be using this supplier again.  Great costume!!!",

No real drawbacks, the only surprise was the shirt which is actually really short in the body just below the bra line, this is hidden by the dress so doesn't matter you just can't tell from the photo.  A must for any back to school fancy dress"

I would have happily paid more for a better quality 10mm thick coloured spot set, but couldn't find anything between these and a very expensive set of Dal Negro ones. They are cheap and perfectly ok. The tin they came in is bit retro looking and I think is actually nicer than the one shown, but hey its a tin.  Double Colour Dominoes"

Thankfully, in my experience with the Thalys and now Duplex models, in comparison to the similarly priced Joueff - later Lima/Hornby - these couple and run better!This set, bought as one of the last available in 2013, was made in 2004 (date stamp in box)  and I have since discovered an italian stockist has 5 more available at lower cost: Dealers nearer to the area these trains ran naturally seem to charge higher prices."

While it worked my 4 year old did enjoy the toy, but I wonder how long her attention would have been held as it doesn't do much. Construction was fine despite looking complicated, but its not very sturdy. Also need to be aware that this toy uses Polly pocket dolls which are much smaller than the normal ones and you can't use the larger ones on this - this isn't clear from the packaging.

I noticed this little 15cm soft toy version of Summer and thought she would be ideal for my daughter and the fact that it was on offer at just a third of it's normal price basically sealed the deal. My problem now is that I gave it to her to play with bu now my son keeps swiping Summer from his sister!My son absolutely loves the Henry Hugglemonster television show on Disney Junior and it's the one show guaranteed to make him completely stop what he's doing and gaze with rapt fascination at the television with lots of smiles and giggles every couple of minutes when Henry or Summer sings or does something funny and my daughter is also transfixed whenever the programme is on too so a bit of a Henry Hugglemonster mad household here!The toy itself is lovely and soft and despite the conflicting age recommendations in the product description (in the main description it says from birth and in the technical details it says from 36 months) I think it is probably suitable from birth rather than 36 months as I can't see any small parts that could come off and be a danger to a baby as the eyes etc are all stitching as opposed to buttons/beads although there is no age confirmation on the label attached to the toy.Read more \u203a  00 it is such a good price as i have seen them in other shops ..."

The model itself has a removable axe included and is pretty much that s all there is, and of course the best child's imagination, to make this a great little play thing.I would question the value for money for the RRP.And the super-strength plastic wrap that encases the product is a bit of a faff to say the least,For ages 3 and up some of the smaller parts could cause a chocking hazard.  Decent toy, if a bit unnecessary",

She's had it for about a month and a half now and has played it at least once every day (usually more!) She loves it! The only negative is that it says it's aimed at 3-5 year olds and I think it's more suitable for slightly younger children.It's very educational and more difficult than pairs as the babies sometimes look very different to the mothers.

                    "This glue is the best for any decopatch or any craft product. It leaves the product glossy and stuck. It dries very fast and is great to use with any tissue paper. It is really amazing and you can really tell the difference against other glues i have used in both the process and with the finished product. Hugely recommend. This glue has lasted at least 4 months without hardening and has made many many crafts with it. The product is of very high quality and it is defiantly worth spending more for this glue than any other brand. Although just beware that it is cheaper elsewhere and you can get a lot more for 10 pounds rather than paying 7 pounds for it here.  good glue",

                    "This is a great game for dino lovers. My son (5) has been hooked on the 'Walking with Dinosaurs' DVD so this seemed an ideal present.The best thing about the game is being able to choose the question level - you can choose the one brain cell, 2 brain cell or 3 brain cells questions - so you still get the satisfaction of getting some right answers even if your knowledge of dinosaurs is fairly basic. It's an ingenious way of making everyone in the game feel like they're getting results, even if they don't come out the overall winner.The questions too are interesting and varied so you feel like you're learning something.Recommended!  Great Value"

                    "I got this because I'd learned to solve the Rubik's cube but couldn't stand the slow turns of the original cube any longer. I found this is perfect as there are no stickers so there's no icky bits peeling off giving the whole cube a much more stylish feel. It's great for showing off and doing finger tricks however the speed at which it spins does mean that I lose control of how many turns it does at once. Also, a few times it has happened that the center pieces have popped out because of the speed of the finger tricks, but it's not too big an issue as they popped back in just as easily as they came out. The only thing that made me consider not buying this specific cube was that I was told that not having stickers meant that the sides get scratched easily. I would like to address this issue. It is not true. My cube has been through everything: school bags, gravely floors, it fell out of my hands a few times and there are no scratches on it. Overall a great product.  my son loves this"

                    "Lets start off with saying that we all love Last of The Summer wine.  The title alone still makes me chuckle.  Visions of a group of old rascals, stretched out on a hill.  A small plate of brie and the sounds of country, (Mooing, Slight trickles of water, the intense silence of a farmer's wife). 'Might as well, lads!' One would say, in regards to the consumption of the WHOLE bottle which one of the old boys 'borrowed' from the Father Mason's (a fictional character's) vicarage!The reason I gave the product only four stars was because I have no idea why anyone would want the Land Rover.  As there is no driver, the vehicle must stay still.  I usually just use it as a prop.  For instance, Compo swerves around the Land Rover.  Compo peers into the Land Rover.  Compo hides from Boglin behind Land Rover.  Compo pulls/pushes the Land Rover.  This final one is done with Blu Tack on the back/front of Compo's chair.  Normally though, I find it easier to place Blu tack on Compo's feet as it looks betterer.All in all, an original toy that's good for playing around the sides of your bath on a Sunday night.  What's with the Land Rover though?  Five Stars",

My little pony was invented in 1982 by sir David little pony, he also invented my little kettle, my little potato masher and the workd famous my little tin of spaghetti hoops.So basically if you like ponies that are tiny, have very little movement but on the plus side have awesome 80's hair and a tattoo on their bum this is right up your street.It also mentions how friendship is magic, its not if you have a friend like my friend Dave, he stinks of coleslaw, it should say 'friendship is magic unless your friends with Dave who smells of coleslaw.

The concept is the same, only it's designed to take a lot less time to play.  Plus, you can play with a group of any size.  Heck, they even give you ideas on how to play by yourself.Inside the tin you get when you buy the game, you'll find instructions, score pads (although you can create your own), and 10 dice.  Four dice contain the numbers 1-4 and two wild spots while the other six dice contain the numbers 5-10.Just like in the original Phase 10, the object is to roll ten previously created phases in order.  For each phase, you need to roll a number of sets (3 of the same number), a run (4-7 for example), or some combination of the two.  The further along you go, the harder it is to complete your phase.  You have three rolls per turn to get your phase.  If you get it, you record a score based on the dice used to complete the phase.  If you miss, you have to work on that phase on your next turn.As another twist on the card game, the objective here is to get the highest final score you can (instead of a low score in the original).  Once one player completes phase 10, everyone gets one last turn to complete as many phases as they can.  Only after everyone has taken that last turn do you compare scores.  The overall high score wins.Because there are only 10 dice in the game, some of the later phases where you need  get really tricky.  Additionally, there is a strategy involved in picking the dice so that you can potentially roll what you need before your turn is over.  I like that twist.I have played the card version of Phase 10 in a very large group for two hours and not had anyone come close to winning.Read more \u203a  One Star"

                    "A Stunning Model of the Lancia Fulvia //  //  //  people found the following review helpful // I'm a very long term and very devoted collector of AutoArt diecast models, either bought from the MiniModels website, or else from Amazon, and my girlfriend always gives me a model as a present on my Birthday, at Christmas, and for our anniversaries.I have a few dozen cars in my collection now, including this particularly stunning Lancia. The AutoArt models which I own all have the following qualities in common. They are exacting in their attention to detail, both the exterior and interior, and are made from very high quality materials which give a good tactile experience, even the rubber tyres are nice to touch. The alloys look great and the paintwork is vibrant and eye catching. The models are quite heavy and need to be handled with care.I bought my first AutoArt model car about six years ago and it still looks as good today as the day I opened the packaging. The one Achilles Heel with these quality models, is the windscreen wipers, which can snag on a cleaning cloth if you're dusting them and get accidentally damaged. I stupidly made that mistake once (and just the once!), with the burgundy coloured and gold wheeled Michael Mann limited edition of the Ferrari 599.The prudent and best thing to do is to exhibit your cherished model inside a display case or cabinet, keeping it free from dust and finger grease. You can buy a suitable plastic or wooden display case for this model, either here from Amazon, or else from the MiniModels website.I take immense pleasure in looking at my collection of AutoArt models at home, which now includes a fleet of Porsche 911's, several Bugatti Veyrons, a Koenigsegg CCX, a Pagani Huayra, and very many different types of Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Read more \u203a"

When set up on a board, there aren't many blatantly obvious imperfections, hence the 4 stars and not 5 stars.You could easily spend a bit more and get a much lower quality standard set than this one. I think the price is pretty fair, because it is very nice to play with and it is hand-made.These 3\" pieces are just below competition standard size and this set has a much better fit, finish and proportion than it's bigger sibbling, the \" set (which is marginally heavier, but not as aesthetically pleasing to me, due to the elongated Kings and Queens, compared with the 3\" set). The set came very well packaged and was pleasing to open up, like opening a nice present. Included was a simple set of rules for chess.

Those wanting a decent size, usable travel set of acceptable quality for a very reasonable price could do far worse than buy this set.As others have noted, it isn't heavy. But, honestly, did you really expect ebony and ivory for the amount this costs? One things's for sure, it's a darn site more pleasurable using this set than one with plastic pieces and a cardboard board.The styling of the pieces is a like-it-or-loathe-it affair. If I have one criticism in this respect,  it''s that the board and it's lettering doesn't really complement the pieces. But that's being picky. For this price, the fact that the board is wooden, folds, and has tailored spaces to house the  pieces when travelling is enough to recommend it.Don't buy this if you want to use it as a centrepiece on a room setting. But give it serious thought if you want a travel set which isn't too small for full-size fingers, or a set to have beside you while you're learning or studying classic games.  Brilliant chess board",
                    "I can't agree with other reviewers who enthuse over the quality of this set. When I first felt the overall weight on delivery I thought that perhaps the pieces weren't included - it really was that light. I guess my point is don't expect a chess set of any substance.But that aside, this set does provide decent value for money, the pieces are of good enough size, as is the board. I'd certainly recommend this as a starter chess set and also as an ideal full sized travel set due to it's light weight construction and it being able to fold in half for storage.  Great chess set, looks as it is in the picture.  Decent quality for a good price."

                    "Though we are asked to rate this chess set as a toy and how much fun it is, is hard to do, as chess is not really a fun thing.When my son told me his son was interested in the game of chess and wanted to learn, my first thought (as a chess player for some 70 years) was that he will be bought one of those silly star wars or similar chess sets, or metal or glass things, that no self respecting chess player would be seen dead with!So I immediately ordered a Staunton, that is accepted world-wide.  Though I have never used a folding chess board, I find this would be more suitable, especially has it actually holds the chess pieces inside.The board seems robust enough and the pieces are wood, weighted and with felt.  The king is a normal three inches odd height, so all in all should be most satisfactory. If he plays at a club or with friends at least he has the proper set.Tom Crossley  Small defects that are annoying"

                    "These dice come in very good condition and seem, (I haven't gamed with them yet), to have a decently even distribution when it comes to rolling them. It is only a minor quibble, but some of the numbers on the dice are not fully filled in, not so much that they can't be read, they are very legible. They are exceptionally good value for what you get.Some of the corners are relatively sharp (such as on the D6 and D4), so the dice come to a stop fairly quickly when rolled, meaning that you're not waiting for a couple of seconds for the dice to stop moving when you want to get on with your game, this also means that they are less likely to give biased results. However some dice, like the D10s have particularly rounded edges, so I'll have to see how they distribute results.On the whole they seem to be very good. I look forward to using them in future.EDIT: I've had these dice for less than two hours and the paint has already started to chip off the D4. Not impressed by that.  Good product",

                    "The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it",
                    "This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy",

There are six to collect - Buzz, Trixie and Woody from original Toy Story and three protagonists.Smallish, at about 5 inches high, but beautifully detailed and it does have the feel of quality and isn't just another piece of plastic tat.At \u00a310 each the full collection will prove expensive, and for that I'm rating four stars, although ignoring the price complete this is a five start product.  Really nice",

It doesn't do a whole lot but is nice looking and obviously very recognisable as a part of the series. As a cynical adult, I can't help but look at these as a blatant attempt to expand a franchise purely to create more merchandise to sell, but my sins are big Toy Story fans and they don't seem to have a problem with this...

The model itself has a removable axe included and is pretty much that s all there is, and of course the best child's imagination, to make this a great little play thing.I would question the value for money for the RRP.And the super-strength plastic wrap that encases the product is a bit of a faff to say the least,For ages 3 and up some of the smaller parts could cause a chocking hazard.  Decent toy, if a bit unnecessary",

To be honest the main reason I have dropped a star is the current SRP of \u00a39 which seems to be very steep and I would have put a price tag of close to \u00a39 on it myself, perhaps this is aimed at an adult collector market?

It is crafted well, and there is a lot of detail for such a little model.It is nicely painted, and it is very clear a lot of effort has gone into this.I would not recommend it for small children, as there are very small parts that may be hazardous, but it would be a great add on to anybody who loves buzz and collects these kind of items.

So i'd rate this as a great starter modelMy next step is to get some paint and paint it....  Tamiya"

                    "This is a shopping game that encourages counting, turn taking and observational skills.  Each player (up to 4) gets a different shopping list consisting of 5 items, and by throwing the dice and moving around the board you can pick up the matching items if you land on the relevant squares.  The first to complete the shopping list is the winner.My kids quite like playing with this, they enjoy rolling the die and counting the squares to move.  They also like it when they can pick up the items on their list.What they don't like (and this happens a lot) is moving around the board again and again because they fail to get to the necessary square to pick up the one or two items remaining on their list.  Quite often all the players are stuck in a merry-go-round, going round and round the board because no one can hit the needed square to pick up the last item on the list.  There are two of each type of square (two grocery squares, two dairy squares, etc.) but this doesn't help as the item is only located at one of them, so if you're after milk and you land on the other dairy square then tough.If you're lucky you can finish the game quite quickly and everyone is happy, but if you're not able to land on the correct squares then the game develops into such tedium that your kids will get bored or angry.  That's why I only let them play this game occasionally.  Checkout Chase"

The product description states that you can both see and drink while wearing. Seeing is highly dependent on the material colour and how much you stretch it. Low ambient light will be an issue. Drinking is through the fabric.  My feedback is positive and I have no complaints!  I am a happy customer!  Thank you!  Mark"

                    "The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it",
                    "It's very eye catching. Once into it's cube people do ask how you can do it if it's all the same colour and then impressed how it changes form once turned!My son loves things that gives him attention and this does the trick! It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun.",
                    "This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy",
                    "Damn tricky, but totally brillient puzzle. It turns and all that smoothly without any problems. I've been playing with it every day since I got it and the stickers havn't budged, all in all a very good piece.Compared to the rubiks cube, this one is all gold rather than coloured tiles, which makes it extra tricky, as this time it's all about the sizes and shapes of the pieces rather than where the coloured tile is.  Very smooth",
                    "the puzzle is very smooth and it is challenging to solve base on size rather than colour. I love it.  It's a great novelty cube that gives hours of fun",
                    "It was a gift for my partner. He loved it a lot... The only thing was the gold plates were easily peeled and scratched... also there was a clicking noise when he turns it in a certain way... Other than that, it's a perfect way to lose track of the whole day!  dont read anymore reviews and just buy one!",

                    "One grandchild collects these,  another for the collection, he loved it , plays with several all day long if allowed  Great puzzle",
                    "Mmm well i am 40 and can do the rubicks cube inabout 10 min everytime ok not a speeder but still if.........look trust me stop reading and buy both the mirror and the gold version you not regret it, i had to wake the wife up when i got mine i wa so happy how it works when you have the nack to mix it up which is hard to start with you can really start to scratch your head, i have a autistic 2 year old with a 10 minute this is intresting span and then throw it and she loves playing with them (prefers the silver mirror one) and will then give it me to put it right, so yeah trust us both and buy both you will love them no cube set is done without these i would add a mixed up photo for you but that would spoil it im sure.  Great variant on the standard cube"

That way, you could achieve that slick look from later in the film.Perhaps that's for another wave of this Black Series.  Amazingly detailed figure",
                    "I bought this guy, Phasma and a First Order Stormtrooper for my Star Wars mad nephew but even though he was chuffed to bits with them, I had issues with the look of them. The Stormtrooper was very badly painted, Phasma looks good but is just painted grey not chrome but Ren was awful. The silver paint round his mask looked like it had been done by a heavy drinker with the DTs. His silver belt buckle wasn't even finished as half the silver was missing and don't get me started on the mixture of cloth and rubber for his costume. These figures aint cheap and my nephew picked up on the errors right away as he has most of the Black Series figures and most of them are really well presented. Are these figures shoddily done to quickly get them out in the shops by the time the movie hits theatres? It's a shame The Force Awakens Black Series figures are this badas the OT ones are really good. Give these a miss unless you can get them real cheap.  Disappointing.",

They were attached to the dress and I didn't find this comfortable. I unpicked the stitches so they weren't attached to the dress any more and wore them on my arms. I was free to move my arms and found this much more comfortable and only took a couple of minutes to do. Had a great night and didn't have a single problem with the dress! Would definitely recommend, also the dress is stretchy so fits many sizes.  Great costume"

                    "So my costume arrived on time as usual. I can never complain about delivery from Amazon.Quality wise, it is fine. Perhaps not really worth the \u00a330 or so it costs but it is OK. I noticed a few loose strands of cotton around the buttons that had to be trimmed off. But it does look better than most of the cheaper outfits you will find in certain supermarkets.Sizing is small. I ordered large, I'm 6ft and slim build so fit between medium and large depending on brands with normal clothes. This thing feels short, sleeves are short, it doesn't reach my waist so I will have to wear a black t - shirt underneath.I would suggest anyone who is taller than 5ft 8 needs to buy XL.

The motion isn't as spectacular as we'd imagined but that might be more because we'd been planning it for over a year.  You do need to be prepared to black out your eyes and find a costume that covers the head and neck.  Tbh a static mask would have done the same job for a lot less money!"

One day she said \"Well, where is my cosutme then.\"  As a person who has had to shop in Evans for larger size clothes in the past (although she is losing weight and look good on it) I didn't think even if I could find a costume it would be any good.  Seeing this outfit advertised I thought I would buy it if only to give her a laugh.  When it arrived I was disappointed at its condition.  Although it was new, it had obviously been taken out of its original packing and stuffed back in.  The costume was creased and not well presented.  I would not have accepted it in this condition had I seen it in a shop but it was not so bad that I felt it should be returned.  When I gave it to her I got the laugh I wanted.  When she tried it on, however I got the thrill this costume should evoke.  It was far better made than some of the dressing up outfits and even the boots fitted.  My only complaint is that the zip at the back doesn't stay up (Maybe it was designed to fall open!)  It is a costume that could be worn out to a party and not just to stay on for a few minuets in the bedroom.  It even made her feel better.  A little on the large side"

I would suggest NOT pumping this up to the limit but sufficient for an average sized toddler to be able to rest/sit on the side of the pool (yellow). the flower jet and shower do work and there is a tap on the connector so you can turn it off at the pool rather than running backwards and forwards to the garden tap. the connector has a threaded section to take an adaptor (supplied) to connect to a push fit hozelock type garden hose connector (not supplied).The balls are included.overall a good buy but really meant for toddlers, our granddaughter (1) absolutely loves it and I would like to think she will get 2-3 years out of it.  but not the best quality only had it up in my lounge to ..."

If you look closely at the teeth you will know what i am talking about.The only issue that I can think about this, is the fact that it can have trouble standing up, but thats to be expected.If you love your Dinosaurs, Then papo is the most realistic you are going to get!Do prefer the normal sitting rex though ;)  Looks great"

Though I have never used a folding chess board, I find this would be more suitable, especially has it actually holds the chess pieces inside.The board seems robust enough and the pieces are wood, weighted and with felt.  The king is a normal three inches odd height, so all in all should be most satisfactory. If he plays at a club or with friends at least he has the proper set.Tom Crossley  Small defects that are annoying"

                    "Model Kasten have a reputation for quality hard plastic tracks. If they were cast in white metal they'd give Fruilmodel a run for their money. Then again there IS the difference between \u00a38-\u00a39 for MK & \u00a330 odd for Fruil... It is (for me) horses for courses. If I have a project that has a need for 'saggy' tracks, then I would put out (sotospeak} for Fruilmodel. For a Tiger, Panther, T-55, Bren Carrier, Type 97 etc. 'saggy' that you can see, are a must. Yes, you can glue plastic tracks so as to LOOK saggy... but the weight of metal tracks... Well, this really IS a \"me\" thing. 'Taught' (I hope I've spelt that right...) tracks & them as you can't see much of --- Sherman, Churchill, CharB, Somua, Maus, E100, Chieftain, Challenger, Abrams etc., yes, there are some very nice 'rubber band' tracks with kits these days.. again, it's pretty much a \"me\" thing. Actually some kits DO include some Very nice seperate-link tracks. Tamiya's CharB & Somua for two... 'Link and Lenght' turn up as an option as well. But for choice... and you would not believe how many different types of track the Sherman used in action (and they are all available from AfterMarket suppliers....) , I shop around for seperate links.As to THIS particular set of tracks. I don't need them right now but will put them together in front of the television, a few tracks at a time. When they are done, they will be boxed, ready for a deserving Sherman product (I have a nice photo of one from 16th/18th Hussars in mind). DON'T do them in a big hurry... you will frustrate the Living Daylights out of yourself or drive yourself Daft... Trust Me On This, lots of very tricky parts. But VERY nice when done. Like I say. Do a few at a time between other projects.Best of luckBill."

                    "The product itself is of decent quality, better than I expected for the low price so I'm very happy in that respect. Movement is good, alignment relatively easy with only a bit more care needed with positioning. The shape of the blocks makes the standard moves seem less familiar but the internal mechanism appears to be solid.The puzzle itself is a very nice extension to the standard 3x3x3 cube. The completely asymmetrical nature of the blocks means that you're challenged in a different way compared to the normal colours which are easy to spot.Recommended for anyone who has the standard 3x3x3 cube sorted and wants something slightly different.  Grandchild loved it",
                    "This is a very cheap cube and the quality is what you might expect for such a low price.Upon opening the package I could feel that the cube had a very loose feel to it, this would have caused the cube to come apart during normal use, so I set about tightening it up - quite an easy job, you just pop off the centre cap on each side and tighten the screw beneath it) This improved the feel of the cube and I set about having a play with it, after a few mins I could feel the edge of a couple of stickers catching on my fingers and when I checked several of the gold coloured stickers were peeling away at the edges. None of the stickers have come off yet, but I have only played with it for 10-15mins, I don't think they will last for more than an hour's actual play time.Solving the cube is harder than with a normal 3x3x3 cube as all the colours are the same and you have to figure out which shapes go where, if you don't mind the build quality then it will be entertaining and make you think in a different way that the normal cubes.Overall a neat cube which has been let down by it's build quality.  Nice toy",

                    "Mmm well i am 40 and can do the rubicks cube inabout 10 min everytime ok not a speeder but still if.........look trust me stop reading and buy both the mirror and the gold version you not regret it, i had to wake the wife up when i got mine i wa so happy how it works when you have the nack to mix it up which is hard to start with you can really start to scratch your head, i have a autistic 2 year old with a 10 minute this is intresting span and then throw it and she loves playing with them (prefers the silver mirror one) and will then give it me to put it right, so yeah trust us both and buy both you will love them no cube set is done without these i would add a mixed up photo for you but that would spoil it im sure.  Great variant on the standard cube",

Probably the best 1/ mm gun in 1/72 scale. If you can get hold of one, get it they won't be around long."

                    "My 4 year old brought this puppet home for the weekend as part of a school project. She was so sad when she had to return it to school so I thought let's try good old amazon and see if I can find something similar. Amazon didn't let me down and I found a supplier offering the exact same puppet.  Nice quality item. The price for the puppet was reasonable but the postage was nearly as much again although I did receive it the very next day.  Would have been happy to wait a bit longer for delivery and pay less postage hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.  Five Stars"

                    "On the warm up to my Christmas poker games I decided to improve my shuffling skills, so I dug up a few decks of nice cards and decided to go for it. The cards I was using were casino grade card, one pack cost around about 5GBP per pack and the other was around 8GBP. Both packs had been used for some games, but were still in pristine condition. In the space of a week I had wrecked the cheaper set with the more expensive set fairing better, but the edges were starting to separate. Both sets were permanently bent in the middle. Admittedly, I was making some mistakes and clashing edges against each other and roughly handling them as I bent them for a shuffle. I decided that I needed to invest in a more robust set of cards.I was reluctant to buy these due to the hefty 22 GBP price tag, thinking I could buy 4-5 sets for the same price, but I threw caution to the wind and I am glad I did. I have really put these cards through their pace. Bending half packs to almost 90 degrees as I shuffle them and after almost 2 weeks of 10 min per night shuffling they still look like new with almost no evidence of permanent bending.Whilst my shuffling had improved through the use of the paper based cards I was still making mistakes and clashing these together, but as they are one piece plastic/cellulose there are no edges to peel apart. They are a bit easier to bend and this reduces hand strain when constantly shuffling. The cards slide smoothly across each other which makes a big difference when bending them to go in for a shuffle - the paper based cards were starting to grind. The cards smooth surface allows the cards to space evenly and so as your thumb slides across the edge to release the card it is done fluidly and much more evenly.Read more \u203a  The best playing cards"

My only issues were that it doesn't have a mechanism to flip out the two dart guns (you have to flick your hand to flip them manually, basically) and, possibly because of that, had no way to keep them locked in place outside firing (so if you just held your arm down beside you, they'd flip out, possibly even dropping the darts). It does fire, but I'm not sure it's been thought through as well as most Nerf products.  Recommended product",

They are nicely balanced, all six spin well and the painting is nicely done, not perfectly even, with attractive colours. I would happily recommend these to others.  Amazing and fun",

They are well made from solid wood and painted in a variety of bright primary colours likely to appeal to children and adults alike, with patterns in contrasting paint. The patterns look particularly attractive as they spin.As indicated in the details for this product the tops are very small, which makes them perfect for little fingers, party bags and crackers.Outstanding value and arrived promptly, so nothing at all to complain about!
